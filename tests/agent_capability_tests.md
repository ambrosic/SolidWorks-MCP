# SolidWorks MCP Agent Capability Tests

These tests evaluate an AI agent's ability to use the SolidWorks MCP server tools. Each test is self-contained and can be copy-pasted into a fresh Claude session connected to the MCP server. Tests are ordered from basic to advanced.

**How to use:** Copy a single test block (everything between the horizontal rules) into a new Claude conversation that has the SolidWorks MCP server connected. Verify the result in SolidWorks matches the expected outcome.

**Prerequisites:** SolidWorks must be running on the machine. The MCP server must be registered in Claude Desktop's config.

**Conventions:**
- Every test that produces a solid body starts with `solidworks_new_part` for consistency.
- Every test that produces a solid body ends with `solidworks_get_mass_properties` and reports the expected volume so the result can be verified numerically.

```

**Expected outcome:**
- `solidworks_new_part` is called first
- Sketch on Top plane
- 35mm cube created
- **Expected volume: 42,875 mm^3** (35 x 35 x 35)

**Tools that must be called:**
1. `solidworks_new_part`
2. `solidworks_create_sketch` with plane "Top"
3. `solidworks_sketch_rectangle` with width=35, height=35, centerX=0, centerY=0
4. `solidworks_create_extrusion` with depth=35
5. `solidworks_get_mass_properties`

## Test 28: Exit Sketch Explicitly

**What it tests:** Using `solidworks_exit_sketch` independently (not as part of extrusion).

**Prompt:**

```
On the Front plane, draw a 50mm radius circle at the origin. Exit the sketch without extruding. Then tell me you've exited the sketch successfully.
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Circle drawn in sketch
- `solidworks_exit_sketch` called explicitly
- Agent confirms sketch was exited
- No extrusion is performed

**Tools that must be called:**
1. `solidworks_create_sketch` with plane "Front"
2. `solidworks_sketch_circle` with radius=50
3. `solidworks_exit_sketch`

---

## Test 29: Describe-and-Build (Natural Language Comprehension)

**What it tests:** Agent's ability to interpret a natural language description (no explicit coordinates) and choose appropriate tool parameters.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a new part. I need a simple phone stand. Create a rectangular base that's about 80mm wide, 50mm deep, and 5mm thick. Then add a vertical wall on one end that's about 80mm wide, 30mm tall, and 5mm thick — this wall will prop up the phone. Report the final volume.
```

**Expected outcome:**
- The agent should figure out the coordinate system and tool calls on its own
- A base plate created as an extrusion (e.g., 80x50mm rectangle, extruded 5mm)
- A vertical wall attached to one end (a second sketch on a face of the base, extruded upward)
- The result should look like a simple L-shaped phone stand
- **Expected volume: ~32,000 mm^3** (80x50x5 base + 80x30x5 wall = 20,000 + 12,000)

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the agent plan a reasonable multi-step approach?
- Does it choose correct planes/faces for each feature?
- Are the dimensions roughly matching the request?
- Does the final shape function as described?
- Does the reported volume approximate the expected value?

**Tools that must be called:**
1. `solidworks_new_part`
2. `solidworks_create_sketch` (base)
3. `solidworks_sketch_rectangle` (base profile)
4. `solidworks_create_extrusion` (base)
5. `solidworks_create_sketch` (wall — on a face)
6. `solidworks_sketch_rectangle` (wall profile)
7. `solidworks_create_extrusion` (wall)
8. `solidworks_get_mass_properties`

---

## Test 30: Error Recovery

**What it tests:** Agent's ability to handle and recover from errors (e.g., trying to extrude without a sketch).

**Prompt:**

```
Create a new part. Immediately try to extrude 50mm without creating a sketch first. After that fails, properly create a sketch on the Front plane with a 30mm x 30mm rectangle and extrude it 50mm. Report the volume.
```

**Expected outcome:**
- First extrusion attempt should fail (no sketch to extrude)
- Agent recognizes the error and recovers
- Agent creates a proper sketch with a rectangle
- Second extrusion succeeds
- Final result: a 30x30x50mm rectangular block
- **Expected volume: 45,000 mm^3** (30 x 30 x 50)

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the agent attempt the extrusion as requested?
- Does it handle the error gracefully?
- Does it successfully recover and complete the part?
- Does the reported volume match the expected value?

**Tools that must be called:**
1. `solidworks_new_part`
2. `solidworks_create_extrusion` with depth=50 (this should fail)
3. `solidworks_create_sketch` with plane "Front"
4. `solidworks_sketch_rectangle` with width=30, height=30, centerX=0, centerY=0
5. `solidworks_create_extrusion` with depth=50
6. `solidworks_get_mass_properties`

## Test 31: Comprehensive 2D Sketch (Every Sketch Tool)

**What it tests:** Every 2D sketch entity tool, every positioning mode, constraints, construction geometry, and shape info queries — all in one sketch. This is the ultimate sketch capability test.

**Prompt:**

```
Create a new part and open a sketch on the Front plane. Build the following sketch step by step. Do NOT extrude — this is a 2D sketch test only.

1. Draw a 60mm x 40mm rectangle centered at (-80, 0). This is the main reference shape.

2. Query the last shape info to confirm the rectangle's bounding box.

3. Draw a circle with radius 15mm, spaced 10mm to the right of the rectangle (use the spacing parameter).

4. Draw a regular octagon (8 sides) with radius 12mm, spaced 10mm to the right of the circle.

5. Draw an ellipse centered at (80, 0) with semi-major axis 25mm, semi-minor axis 12mm, rotated 30 degrees.

6. Draw a slot from (-80, -50) to (-30, -50) with width 12mm.

7. Draw a line from (0, -50) to (50, -50).

8. Draw a second line from (0, -65) to (50, -58) — intentionally slightly angled.

9. Apply a PARALLEL constraint between the two lines (step 7 and step 8).

10. Draw a 3-point arc from (60, -50) to (100, -50) with midpoint at (80, -35).

11. Draw a center-point arc with center (80, -70), start (95, -70), end (80, -55).

12. Draw a spline through these points: (-80, 50), (-60, 65), (-40, 55), (-20, 70), (0, 50).

13. Draw a vertical centerline from (40, 30) to (40, 70).

14. Draw a horizontal line from (20, 50) to (60, 50).

15. Toggle that horizontal line (step 14) to construction geometry.

16. Place a sketch point at (0, 0) as a reference origin marker.

17. Insert the text "TEST" at position (-80, 80) with a height of 8mm.

18. Draw a 50mm x 20mm rectangle positioned 15mm to the right of the ellipse from step 5 (use relativeX=15 to offset from the ellipse's center).

19. Query the last shape info to confirm the final rectangle's position.

After all entities are drawn, exit the sketch.
```

**Expected outcome:**

This sketch should contain ALL of the following entity types:
- **Rectangle** (steps 1, 18) — absolute positioning and relative positioning
- **Circle** (step 3) — spacing-based positioning
- **Polygon** (step 4) — spacing-based positioning, 8 sides
- **Ellipse** (step 5) — with rotation angle
- **Slot** (step 6) — explicit coordinates
- **Line** (steps 7, 8, 14) — explicit coordinates
- **Constraint** (step 9) — PARALLEL between two lines
- **3-point arc** (step 10) — explicit coordinates
- **Center-point arc** (step 11) — center + endpoints
- **Spline** (step 12) — 5 control points
- **Centerline** (step 13) — construction geometry
- **Toggle construction** (step 15) — convert normal line to construction
- **Point** (step 16) — reference point
- **Text** (step 17) — sketch annotation
- **get_last_shape_info** (steps 2, 19) — spatial tracking queries
- **exit_sketch** (final step) — explicit sketch exit

**Positioning modes covered:**
- Absolute centerX/centerY (steps 1, 5)
- Spacing from last shape (steps 3, 4)
- relativeX/relativeY offset (step 18)
- Explicit x1,y1,x2,y2 coordinates (steps 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14)

**Detailed position verification:**
- Step 1 rectangle: center (-80, 0), bounds [-110, -50] x [-20, 20]
- Step 3 circle: right edge of rectangle is -50, so circle center = -50 + 10 + 15 = -25, y = 0
- Step 4 octagon: right edge of circle is -10, so octagon center = -10 + 10 + 12 = 12, y = 0
- Step 18 rectangle: ellipse center is (80, 0), so rect center = (80 + 15, 0) = (95, 0)
